# Computational Molecular Medicine Course Project
This is a final project for JHU 550.650 Computational Molecular Medicine in Spring 2018. The project was collaborated with [tana777](https://github.com/tana777), hence you will find an identical repository in her github. I was responsible for feature selection and model tuning and evaluation.

The project is about head and neck cancers. Traditionally non-invasive methods to assess metastases in the neck lymph-nodes are not accurate and it is usually necessary to surgically remove the lymph-nodes to investigate the presence or absence of metastases (neck lymph-nodes dissection). 

Using Machine Learning predictive algorithms to build a more precise model could help us reduce over-treatment by sparing neck lymph-nodes dissection to patients who do not have metastases.
